# Country Clustering for Humanitarian Aid Prioritization

This repository contains a project that leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster countries based on socioeconomic and health indicators. The goal is to identify patterns and groupings that can assist organizations, such as HELP International, in prioritizing countries for humanitarian aid. By using data-driven insights, this approach aims to optimize resource allocation and maximize the impact of aid efforts.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Exploration and preprocessing of socioeconomic and health datasets.
- **Clustering Models**: Implementation of unsupervised learning algorithms, such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Visualization**: Clear and interpretable visualizations of clustering results.
- **Insights**: Actionable insights to guide decision-making for humanitarian aid prioritization.

## Use Cases

- Identifying countries with similar socioeconomic and health challenges.
- Supporting data-driven decision-making for resource allocation.
- Enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid programs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ikenna1011/Country-Clustering-for-Humanitarian-Aid-Prioritization.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis scripts to generate clustering results.
